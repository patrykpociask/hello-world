A mistake in a spreadsheet set in motion a series of events that delayed the opening of a £150m hospital, a new report has revealed.

Last-minute issues with ventilation prevented the opening of Edinburgh's new children's hospital last July.

An NHS Lothian-commissioned review found a "human error" in a 2012 spreadsheet with the specifications for air flow in critical care rooms.

The mistake was missed in what auditors describe as a "collective failure".

It was only when the hospital had been handed over to NHS Lothian, and £1.4m monthly repayments had started, that independent checks found the critical care rooms were operating with the wrong air flow.

Remedial work worth £16m has since been carried out and the new Sick Kids building started hosting outpatient appointments in July.

But the hospital's full opening date, previously pencilled in for the autumn, is under review in light of the coronavirus crisis.

NHS Lothian said it had already made a number of the recommendations for improvement in the report to "ensure that future capital projects will benefit".
